# Object-tracker-collection-Opencv-DeepLearning
Collection of object-tracker projects of hot topics, with opencv and deep learning (for some projects).   
(The code comments using here is chinese)

----------------------------------------------------
## object-tracker-based-on-color
The implemetation of object-movemnt-tracking based on color (green in this example).

----------------------------------------------------
## Face-centroids-track-and-counter
A project can tracking and counting faces in real time, can be seen as a paramount to build a ***Person-Counter***. .

----------------------------------------------------
## Faster-object-tracker-with-opencv-constructor
Apply detection only once and then track it in every subsequent frame, leading to faster tracking pipline.  
(Using functions provided by OpenCV)
